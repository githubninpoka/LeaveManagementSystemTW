This repository is a code-along of a course on ASP.NET and MVC.

Along the way, what were some things that are noteworthy:
- I got a better understanding of the MVC pattern. What belongs in the views, what in the models, and what defines the controller.
- Implemented Authentication and authorization with the standard aspnetcore templates.
- extra attention to separating the code into different projects.
- With the service pattern I got a chance to work with more complex Entity Framework queries.
- And of course I got some good exercise and a chance to debug errors.

The application itself is a basic Leave Management System. It allows for registration of vacation etc.
- An admin can create types of leave and allocate to users.
- A user can request and cancel leave.
- The admin can then approve or decline the leave.
