This repository is a code-along of a course on ASP.NET and MVC.

Along the way:
- A good understanding of the MVC pattern. What belongs in the views, what in the models, and what defines the controller.
- Authentication and authorization with the standard aspnetcore templates.
- extra attention to separating the code into different projects.
- do more than simple updates with Entity Framework.
- and of course just good exercise and debugging errors.
